# Spectra PDF — E2E test suite

WebdriverIO + `tauri-driver` driving the actual built binary against an
embedded WebView2. Tests use a renderer-side test harness exposed at
`window.__SPECTRA_TEST__`, only compiled in when `VITE_E2E=1` is set at
build time. Release builds never set the flag — the global is absent in
shipped binaries.

## One-time setup

```powershell
cargo install tauri-driver --locked
cargo install --git https://github.com/chippers/msedgedriver-tool
msedgedriver-tool   # downloads msedgedriver matching local Edge
npm ci              # in e2e-tests/
```

## Build the test binary

From the repo root:

```powershell
$env:VITE_E2E = "1"
npx tauri build --debug --no-bundle
```

`tauri build --debug` embeds the production frontend into the binary, so
the suite exercises the same renderer path as a release build.
`--no-bundle` skips the NSIS installer step.

The output is `src-tauri/target/debug/spectrapdf.exe`.

Prereqs for the binary to actually start the engine: `resources/python/`
must contain a working `python.exe` (run `scripts/setup-python-embed.ps1`
once) and `resources/ghostscript/` must exist (stub `gswin64c.exe` +
`gsdll64.dll` are fine for tests that don't exercise GS).

## Run the suite

```powershell
npm test
```

WebdriverIO spawns `tauri-driver` on port 4444, launches the binary, and
runs every `specs/*.spec.ts` file.

## What's covered (v1)

| Spec | Verifies |
|---|---|
| `01-boot.spec.ts` | Header renders, version is shown, harness installs |
| `02-open-pdf.spec.ts` | Valid PDF loads, page count is correct, dirty=false |
| `03-view-switch.spec.ts` | Header view switcher (Home / Tools / Pages) works |
| `04-save-as.spec.ts` | Working copy serializes to disk as a non-empty PDF |
| `05-malformed-refuse.spec.ts` | Structurally broken PDF is refused, app stays alive |

## Adding a spec

1. Drop a file in `specs/`. Use the helpers from `support/harness.ts`.
2. Use `openByPaths` and `saveActiveAs` from the harness, which open and
   save through the engine directly rather than the native Win32 dialogs.
3. Keep fixtures under `fixtures/`. Anything > 100 KB should be
   `.gitignore`d and committed only if hand-curated and stable.

## Tooling

WebdriverIO drives W3C WebDriver through `tauri-driver` → `msedgedriver`,
exercising the as-built binary directly and matching Tauri's official
example shape.
