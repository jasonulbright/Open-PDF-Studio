## 1.0.0 — The Canvas Workspace

Open PDF Studio grows from a batch-operations tool into a visual PDF workspace:
open several files as page strips on one canvas, rearrange pages within and
across them, annotate, redact, fill and build forms, sign, OCR, and compare —
every edit staged in memory, applied atomically, and undoable. The CLI keeps
full parity for every whole-file transform.

### The canvas
- Multi-file canvas: every open PDF is a strip of live page thumbnails; drag
  pages to reorder within a document, move them between documents, or pull
  them out into a new one — single pages or multi-selections (Ctrl/Shift
  click, Ctrl+A), always as one undo step
- Whole-document merge: one click appends a document's pages to the one
  above; drop files onto a document to import their pages at that position,
  or use the per-row "add pages" control
- Staged edits: rotations, deletions, moves, imports, and annotations stay
  in memory until "Apply changes" commits every touched file atomically;
  multi-level undo/redo spans staged edits and applied operations
- The `.pdfx` format: several documents saved as one ordinary,
  fully-compatible PDF that reopens as separate strips
- Keyboard shortcuts throughout (Ctrl+Z/Y, Ctrl+A, Delete, `[`/`]` rotate,
  Ctrl+F find, Ctrl+=/−/0 zoom)

### Annotate, redact, sign
- Highlights, text boxes, freehand ink, and preset stamps with notes,
  recoloring, and a comments sidebar; existing PDF annotations import as
  editable objects
- True redaction: marked regions are REMOVED from the file's content —
  text, images, nested form XObjects, and overlapping annotations — never
  merely covered
- Digital signatures: verify embedded signatures (cryptographic validity +
  document integrity, with an honest trust caveat); sign with a .pfx or a
  PEM key + certificate, place a visible stamp anywhere on a page, generate
  a self-signed identity in-app — or click an empty signature field and
  sign directly into it
- Watermarks (text, any angle, auto-fit) and PDF compare: a text diff with
  word-level highlights AND a pixel-level visual diff that catches
  scanned/image-only changes

### Forms
- Fill AcroForm fields directly on the page — text, checkboxes, radios,
  dropdowns, list boxes — with pending values that survive page edits, then
  bake them in one click; or use the classic panel
- Create new fields by drawing them: text, checkbox, radio group, dropdown,
  option list, and empty signature fields
- Form fields now survive every structural operation — page moves and
  rotations, merges, splits, page deletion, compression, and grayscale
  conversion all preserve fields and their values

### Find & OCR
- In-viewer Find (Ctrl+F) across every open file with match navigation and
  per-word highlights
- Scanned pages OCR automatically (offline, bundled recognition); "Make
  searchable" persists an invisible text layer into the file — the page
  stays pixel-identical and its text becomes selectable and searchable in
  any PDF reader
- Bookmarks: a click-to-jump outline sidebar with drag-reorder, plus the
  full tree editor; bookmark links and actions survive editing

### CLI
- New subcommands: `forms` (read/fill/flatten), `outline` (get/set JSON),
  `redact`, `watermark`, `compare` (text + `--visual`), `verify-signatures`,
  `sign` (including `--existing-field`), and `generate-signer`

### Fixed
- Merging, splitting, deleting pages, compressing, or converting a form PDF
  no longer silently destroys its form fields
- Engine I/O is UTF-8 end to end — non-ASCII text (names, bookmarks, form
  values) round-trips correctly in both GUI and CLI (was cp1252 on Windows)
- Reopening an already-open file can no longer briefly serve its previous
  in-memory state
